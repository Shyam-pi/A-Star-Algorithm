# A* Algorithm Implementations for Point and Mobile Robots

This repository contains implementations of the A* algorithm for both point and mobile robots. A* is a widely-used pathfinding algorithm in robotics and artificial intelligence for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph.

## Introduction

The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path between a start node and a goal node on a graph. It is commonly used in robotics for path planning tasks. This repository provides implementations of the A* algorithm for both point and mobile robots.

## Folder Structure

- **/PointRobot**: Contains the implementation of the A* algorithm for point robots.
- **/TurtleBot3**: Contains the implementation of the A* algorithm customized for TurtleBot3.
