# A* Algorithm Implementations for Point and Mobile Robots

This repository contains implementations of the A* algorithm for both mobile point robot and TurtleBot3.

## Introduction

The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path between a start node and a goal node on a graph. It is commonly used in robotics for path planning tasks. This repository provides implementations of the A* algorithm for both point and mobile robots.
